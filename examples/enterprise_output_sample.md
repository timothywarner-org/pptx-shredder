# Azure Storage Fundamentals

*This is part 1 of 3 in the Azure Storage Fundamentals module series.*

**🔒 Compliance Notice:** This content relates to GDPR, SECURITY requirements.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts
- Familiarity with Azure portal navigation
- Knowledge of data classification principles

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Configure blob storage with appropriate security settings
- Implement lifecycle management policies for cost optimization
- Monitor storage metrics and set up alerts for proactive management
- Apply compliance requirements for enterprise data governance

## 📚 Content

### Introduction to Azure Storage

Azure Storage provides a massively scalable, durable, and highly available cloud storage solution. It serves as the foundation for many Azure services and applications.

**Key characteristics:**
- Virtually unlimited scale
- Multiple redundancy options
- Global accessibility
- Enterprise-grade security

### 🧪 Storage Account Configuration

**Objective**: Create and configure a storage account with enterprise security settings

#### Visual Elements:
- **Table**: Storage account types comparison matrix
- **Image**: Azure portal storage account creation workflow

#### 💻 Lab Code:
```powershell
# Create resource group
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "rg-storage-lab" -Location "East US"

# Create storage account with security features
$storageAccount = New-AzStorageAccount `
  -ResourceGroupName "rg-storage-lab" `
  -Name "stentsec$((Get-Random))" `
  -Location "East US" `
  -SkuName "Standard_GRS" `
  -Kind "StorageV2" `
  -AllowBlobPublicAccess $false `
  -EnableHttpsTrafficOnly $true `
  -MinimumTlsVersion "TLS1_2"
```

#### 🧠 Knowledge Check:
**Q**: What is the minimum TLS version required for enterprise security compliance?

#### 👨‍🏫 Instructor Guidance:

**⏱️ Timing:**
- Allow 8 minutes for students to complete the storage account creation
- Spend extra time on security settings explanation

**⚠️ Emphasis:**
- Critical to stress the importance of disabling public blob access
- Emphasize that HTTPS-only traffic is non-negotiable for production

**💡 Examples:**
- Show real-world scenario where public access led to data breach
- Demonstrate cost difference between storage redundancy options

**🔧 Tips:**
- Use naming conventions that include environment and purpose
- Always validate configuration before proceeding to next step

**🚨 Warnings:**
- Never use public access for sensitive enterprise data
- Be careful when selecting redundancy options as they cannot be changed later

### 📊 Data Classification and Compliance

Enterprise data requires proper classification and handling according to regulatory requirements.

#### Classification Levels:
  - **Public**: General information, marketing materials
  - **Internal**: Business data for internal use only  
  - **Confidential**: Sensitive business information
  - **Restricted**: Highly sensitive data requiring special handling

#### Visual Elements:
- **Chart**: Data classification matrix with handling requirements
- **Diagram**: Compliance workflow for data lifecycle management

### 🔒 Security Implementation

**IMPORTANT**: All enterprise storage must implement defense-in-depth security

Security layers include:
- Network access restrictions
- Identity and access management
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging and monitoring

#### 💻 Demo Code:
```bash
# Configure network rules
az storage account network-rule add \
  --resource-group rg-storage-lab \
  --account-name stentsec123 \
  --ip-address 203.0.113.0/24

# Enable blob audit logging
az storage logging update \
  --account-name stentsec123 \
  --services b \
  --log rwd \
  --retention 90
```

> **📝 Instructor Notes:** Emphasize that network rules should be configured before adding any data. Demonstrate how audit logs help with compliance reporting.
